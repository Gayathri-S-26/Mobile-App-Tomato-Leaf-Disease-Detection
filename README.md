# Mobile-App-Tomato-Leaf-Disease-Detection

Plant diseases that might seriously impact agriculture are typically discovered with the naked eye, which can take more time and increase the likelihood of inaccurate detection. This issue can be resolved, and the risk of decreased plant production is decreased with early discovery. To automate the process of detecting and classifying the tomato leaf diseases, the transfer learning technique is efficient. Image classification involves applying the transfer learning algorithm to different convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. InceptionV3 and VGG16 models with CNN are used to classify images via transfer learning architectures to identify diseases. These models are applied to a dataset containing 11,000 images of tomato leaves, including signs of 9 different diseases and healthy leaves. Further, the 9 unhealthy classes are classified into five pathogen types. Finally, the comparative analysis is done on the two pre-trained models, and the best model is selected for predicting the type of disease.
